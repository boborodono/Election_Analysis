## Election Audit Summary
This script can be used in any election -- with modifications -- to determine important information such as:
  1. The breakdown of voter preferences by county to determine where certain candidates are most popular. 
   - This can help to create an ideological map of the electorate.
  3. Tracking the election race in real time by connecting to relevant polling places and regularly refreshing the program to see ongoing results all the way up until the polls close.
